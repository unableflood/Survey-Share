Share my recent work for the survey
This repo contains two projects that I have recently done for one of my CS classes at UC Davis - Operating Systems and System Programming. 
Project 1 is about creating a simple shell that accepts users' input and executes the commands.
Project 3 is about "Implementing an entire FAT-based filesystem software stack: from mounting and unmounting a formatted partition to reading and writing files, and including creating and removing files."

Both projects are done in C, for project 1, I collaborate with someone else, for project 3, it is mostly done by myself(We only did makefile and fs.c in P3).
